Please describe the incident using the following prompts. It's okay to leave some blank at the beginning, 
and you can begin by taking notes in the last prompt section. However, all of these prompts should be 
filled in before the incident can be marked "done".

The sections are modeled after Heroku "Follow-up Reports", example: https://status.heroku.com/incidents/2232.

## Intro

Put the details of when the disruption began and anything else to introduce someone to the incident.

## Who was affected?

List the services and stakeholders affected.

## What happened?

Describe as much as you know about the incident now and fill in this section as you know more.

## What did we do to prevent wider impact?

You might not be able to answer anything other than "nothing", but this section is very contextual to the 
specific incident in question.

## What will we do to mitigate problems like this in the future?

You should be able to provide a decent answer here once the incident is "resolved" or has a planned 
resolution.

If no alert showed up in #de-service-alerts Slack channel, then some issue needs creating to improve 
app monitoring.

## Historical timeline of events

You can link to the original notification in #de-service-alerts channel or write up the timeline some other 
way. This section might be the first part you start writing.
